# FindUrMeds: Break-Even Analysis & Go/No-Go Decision Framework

## Current State Summary

**Revenue to date:** ~$300 total (3 sales)
- Package 1 (full search): $35-50 per search
- Package 2 (confirmation): $5-10 per call
- Margins: 70-80% on Package 1, 90%+ on Package 2

**Current channels:**
- ✅ 2 organic sales (unknown source)
- ❌ 1 Meta ad sale (high CAC, wrong audience)
- 🟡 1 signed partner (Rebecca King) - unclear if will refer
- 🟡 1 possible partner (ADHD coaching group) - technically incompetent, distribution uncertain
- 🟡 Cold email: 5% conversion to meetings, unclear close rate

## Unit Economics

### Revenue Per Transaction

| Package Type | Price | AI Credits Cost | Gross Margin | Net per Sale |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Full Search** | $40 (avg) | $4 | 90% | $36 |
| **Confirmation Call** | $7.50 (avg) | $0.75 | 90% | $6.75 |

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Scenarios

| Customer Type | Monthly Usage | Monthly Revenue | Annual LTV | 2-Year LTV |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Heavy user** | 1 full search/mo | $40 | $480 | $960 |
| **Moderate user** | 1 confirmation/mo | $7.50 | $90 | $180 |
| **One-time user** | 1 search ever | $40 | $40 | $40 |

**Most likely:** Mix of one-time (70%) and monthly (30%)
**Blended LTV estimate:** (0.70 × $40) + (0.30 × $240) = **$100 per customer**

---

## Break-Even Analysis vs $150K Corporate Job

### Annual Salary Replacement Goal: $150,000

**After-tax target:** ~$105,000 (assuming 30% effective tax rate)
**Monthly net income needed:** $8,750/month
**Annual gross revenue needed:** $150,000

### Break-Even Calculations

#### Scenario A: Direct-to-Consumer (One-Time Searches)
- **Revenue per customer:** $40
- **Gross margin:** 90%
- **Net per customer:** $36

**Customers needed annually:** $150,000 ÷ $36 = **4,167 customers/year**
**Customers needed monthly:** 347 customers/month

**With current traction (3 sales total):**
- Current run rate: ~1 sale/month
- Gap to break-even: **346x current volume**

---

#### Scenario B: Direct-to-Consumer (Blended LTV)
- **Blended LTV:** $100 (mix of one-time + recurring)
- **Net per customer:** $90 (90% margin)

**New customers needed annually:** $150,000 ÷ $90 = **1,667 customers/year**
**New customers needed monthly:** 139 new customers/month

**Gap to break-even:** **139x current monthly volume**

---

#### Scenario C: Doctor Referral Channel
- **Assume:** Average doctor refers 5 patients/month
- **Revenue per patient:** $40 (one-time search)
- **Net revenue per patient:** $36
- **Monthly revenue per doctor:** 5 × $36 = $180/month
- **Annual revenue per doctor:** $2,160/year

**Doctors needed for $150K salary:**
- **$150,000 ÷ $2,160 = 69 doctors referring consistently**

**With current status:**
- Signed partners: 1 (Rebecca King, unproven)
- Close rate from meetings: Unknown (you have 5% conversion to meetings from cold email)
- Gap to break-even: **68 more doctors**

---

#### Scenario D: Hospital/Clinic B2B Channel
**From your context doc:** 1 hospital = 1,200 calls/month = 80 searches/month

- **Revenue per hospital:** 80 searches × $40 = $3,200/month = $38,400/year
- **Net revenue per hospital:** $38,400 × 0.90 = $34,560/year

**Hospitals needed for $150K salary:**
- **$150,000 ÷ $34,560 = 4.3 hospitals**
- **Realistically: 5 hospitals to comfortably hit $150K**

**With current status:**
- Pipeline: 1 interested hospital (legal doc in progress)
- Signed: 0
- Gap to break-even: **4-5 hospitals**

---

#### Scenario E: ADHD Coach Partnership (Your New Potential Partner)

**Key question:** How many patients can this neurodivergent coaching group actually refer?

**Optimistic scenario:**
- They have 10 active psychs referring
- Each psych refers 3 patients/month
- 10 psychs × 3 patients = 30 patients/month
- 30 × $40 = $1,200/month = $14,400/year net revenue

**Realistic scenario:**
- They have 3-5 active referrers (not 10)
- Each refers 1-2 patients/month
- 4 × 1.5 = 6 patients/month
- 6 × $40 = $240/month = $2,880/year net revenue

**To hit $150K with this channel alone:**
- Need **52 partnerships like this (optimistic)** OR **312 partnerships (realistic)**

**Verdict:** This is NOT a path to $150K alone. At best, it's 2-10% of your revenue.

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis

### Current Channels

| Channel | CAC | LTV | LTV/CAC Ratio | Verdict |
|---------|-----|-----|---------------|---------|
| **Organic** | $0 | $100 | ∞ | Great but not scalable |
| **Meta Ads** | >$100 (est) | $100 | <1.0 | Unprofitable |
| **Cold Email to Doctors** | ~$20 (time cost) | $2,160 (annual) | 108x | Good if you can close |
| **Hospital B2B** | ~$500 (sales time) | $34,560 (annual) | 69x | Excellent if you can close |
| **Influencer (Rebecca)** | $0 upfront (25-30% commission) | $70 net per customer | N/A | Good if she refers |

### CAC Thresholds for Profitability

**For B2C to work:**
- LTV = $100
- Target LTV/CAC ratio = 3:1
- **Max acceptable CAC = $33**

**Current Meta CAC >$100 → 3x too expensive**

**For doctor channel to work:**
- LTV per doctor = $2,160/year
- Target LTV/CAC = 3:1
- **Max acceptable CAC per doctor = $720**

If you spend 10 hours acquiring a doctor and value your time at $50/hr:
- CAC = $500 → Acceptable (4.3:1 ratio)

---

## Monthly Volume Needed by Channel

### To Replace $150K Salary ($12,500/month gross revenue)

| Channel | Unit | Revenue/Unit | Units Needed/Month |
|---------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **B2C (one-time)** | Customer | $40 | 313 customers |
| **B2C (blended LTV)** | Customer | $8.33/mo avg | 1,500 active customers |
| **Doctors** | Doctor | $180/mo | 69 doctors |
| **Hospitals** | Hospital | $3,200/mo | 4 hospitals |
| **Influencers** | Influencer (Rebecca-scale) | ~$500-1K/mo | 12-25 influencers |

---

## Time to Break-Even Projections

### Scenario 1: Hospital B2B Path (Most Realistic)

**Assumptions:**
- You can close 1 hospital/quarter via warm intros
- Each hospital = $3,200/month revenue
- You start with 0, need 4

**Timeline:**
- Q1 2026: Close hospital #1 → $3,200/mo
- Q2 2026: Close hospital #2 → $6,400/mo
- Q3 2026: Close hospital #3 → $9,600/mo
- Q4 2026: Close hospital #4 → $12,800/mo ✅ **Break-even**

**Time to $150K run rate: 12-15 months**

---

### Scenario 2: Doctor Referral Network (Grind Path)

**Assumptions:**
- Cold email: 5% conversion to meetings
- Meetings to signed doctor: 20% close rate
- Need to email 100 doctors to get 1 signed doctor
- You need 69 doctors

**Timeline:**
- Need to email: 6,900 doctors total
- If you email 50/day: 138 days to reach everyone
- Close rate: 1 doctor/week optimistically
- **Time to 69 doctors: 69 weeks = 16 months**

**Time to $150K run rate: 16-18 months**

---

### Scenario 3: B2C Scaling (Unlikely Given Current CAC)

**Assumptions:**
- You fix Meta CAC to $50 (from $100+)
- You acquire 150 customers/month
- 30% become recurring users

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-3: Test and optimize CAC
- Month 4-6: Scale to 50 customers/month
- Month 7-9: Scale to 100 customers/month
- Month 10-12: Scale to 150 customers/month → $6K MRR
- Month 13-18: Continue scaling to 300 customers/month → $12K MRR ✅ **Break-even**

**Time to $150K run rate: 18-24 months (if CAC gets fixed)**

**Probability CAC gets fixed:** Low (you've tried Meta, it's attracting wrong audience)

---

## The ADHD Coaching Partner: Go/No-Go Framework

### Your Situation
- Neurodivergent group wants you to build them an app
- Technically incompetent ("horrific job")
- Want iOS app (unnecessary), no marketing funnel, obsessing over features
- **POTENTIAL UPSIDE:** They claim to have psych connections who could distribute FindUrMeds

### Red Flags
1. ❌ Obsessing over wrong things (meditation reminders, push notifications)
2. ❌ Insisting on iOS vs web MVP (shows they don't understand MVPs)
3. ❌ "Horrific job" technically (you'll be cleaning up their mess)
4. ❌ Unclear if they actually have distribution (claims vs reality)
5. ❌ Resistant to tech feedback (will be hard to work with)

### Green Flags
1. ✅ Frustrated with existing apps (real pain point)
2. ✅ Could potentially distribute FindUrMeds if you build goodwill
3. ✅ You could position yourself as "tech guy who delivers"

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**GO IF:**
1. They commit IN WRITING to refer ≥10 patients/month to FindUrMeds upon web MVP delivery
2. They agree to web-only MVP (not iOS)
3. They agree to launch in ≤30 days
4. You time-box this to ≤20 hours total

**NO-GO IF:**
1. They won't commit to referrals in writing
2. They insist on iOS app
3. They keep adding features to MVP
4. They can't articulate their distribution network specifically

### Time-Box Recommendation

**Maximum investment: 20 hours over 4 weeks**

**Week 1 (5 hours):**
- Have scoping call: "I can build you a web MVP in 2 weeks if you commit to X, Y, Z"
- Get written commitment: "We will refer 10+ patients/month to FindUrMeds"
- If no commitment → STOP HERE

**Week 2-3 (10 hours):**
- Build dead-simple web MVP (not iOS)
- 1 page with core functionality only
- No meditation reminders, no fancy features

**Week 4 (5 hours):**
- Launch and measure: Did they refer ANY patients?
- If 0 referrals in first month → CUT TIES
- If 5+ referrals → Continue relationship

### Expected Value Analysis

**Optimistic case:**
- 20 hours invested
- They refer 10 patients/month
- 10 × $40 = $400/month = $4,800/year
- ROI: $4,800 ÷ (20 hours × $75/hr value) = **3.2x ROI**

**Realistic case:**
- 20 hours invested
- They refer 2 patients/month (overpromised)
- 2 × $40 = $80/month = $960/year
- ROI: $960 ÷ $1,500 = **0.64x ROI** ❌ NOT WORTH IT

**Worst case:**
- 20 hours invested
- Scope creep → 40 hours
- They refer 0 patients
- ROI: -$3,000 opportunity cost

### Recommendation: CONDITIONAL YES with TIGHT TIME-BOX

**Strategy:**
1. Position this as "I'll build you a quick web MVP in exchange for patient referrals to FindUrMeds"
2. Get written commitment BEFORE you start coding
3. Time-box to 20 hours MAX
4. Measure referrals in month 1
5. If <5 referrals → Cut and run

**Probability this works:** 20-30%
**Downside risk:** 20 hours wasted
**Upside potential:** Steady 5-10 referrals/month = $200-400/mo

**This is NOT your path to $150K, but it's a reasonable 20-hour bet if they commit upfront.**

## Decision Framework: When to Stop FindUrMeds

### STOP Immediately If:
1. ❌ No hospital pilot signed by **March 1, 2026** (4 months from now)
2. ❌ B2C CAC still >$75 after 90 days of testing
3. ❌ Can't get to 10 paid B2C customers in next 60 days
4. ❌ You get job offer >$120K with good equity

### PIVOT (Don't Stop) If:
1. 🟡 1 hospital pilot signed but slow to scale → Focus on getting 2-3 more
2. 🟡 Organic channel is working but unknown source → Invest in figuring it out
3. 🟡 Rebecca King or similar influencer drives 10+ sales/month → Scale influencer model

### DOUBLE DOWN If:
1. ✅ Hospital pilot signed + they're happy + referring you to others
2. ✅ $5K MRR from any channel by March 2026
3. ✅ Clear path to 3-5 hospitals in pipeline

| **ANNUAL TOTAL** | $44,400/yr | $81,000/yr | $121,200/yr |

### Income Requirements (Pre-Tax)

| Lifestyle | After-Tax Need | Pre-Tax Income (30% tax) | Pre-Tax Income (35% tax) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Minimal** | $44,400 | $63,400 | $68,300 |
| **Desired** | $81,000 | **$115,700** | **$124,600** |
| **Premium** | $121,200 | $173,100 | $186,500 |

### Verdict

**To live your desired lifestyle (better clothes, travel, ski/surf):**
- You need **$115-125K pre-tax income**
- This is LESS than the $150K corporate job benchmark
- **FindUrMeds needs to generate $120K/year to support desired lifestyle**

**Break-even is actually lower than $150K job:**
- **3-4 hospitals** (not 5) = $103-138K revenue
- **50 active doctors** (not 69) = $108K revenue
- **Blended B2C**: ~100 customers/month at $100 LTV = $120K annualized

---

## Summary: The Numbers You Need to Know

### Current State
- **Revenue:** $300 total (3 sales)
- **Run rate:** ~$100/month
- **Gap to desired lifestyle:** **120x current revenue**

### Break-Even Targets (for $120K income)

| Channel | Current | Needed | Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Hospitals** | 0 | 3-4 | +3-4 |
| **Doctors** | 1 unproven | 50 active | +49 |
| **B2C customers/mo** | 1 | 100 | +99 |

### 90-Day Success Criteria (Jan 31, 2026)
- ✅ 1 hospital pilot signed OR
- ✅ 15 doctor partnerships OR
- ✅ $4K MRR from any channel OR
- ✅ Clear CAC <$50 path

**If none of these hit → Stop FindUrMeds, get job**

### Time to Break-Even by Channel
- **Hospital B2B:** 12-15 months (most realistic)
- **Doctor Network:** 16-18 months (grind path)
- **B2C:** 18-24 months (if CAC gets fixed - unlikely)

### ADHD Coaching Partner Decision
- ✅ Time-box to 20 hours
- ✅ Get written commitment for referrals FIRST
- ❌ Don't build iOS app
- ❌ Walk away if no referrals in month 1

### Recommended Path Forward
1. **Focus 80% energy on hospital B2B** (highest ROI, fastest path)
2. **Spend 15% on doctor cold email** (scalable, proven 5% meeting rate)
3. **Spend 5% on ADHD coach partnership** (time-boxed bet)
4. **Pause Meta ads** (CAC too high)
5. **Start job search in parallel** (don't wait for FindUrMeds to fail)

### Decision Date: **January 31, 2026**
- Re-evaluate progress
- GO, NO-GO, or MAYBE (side project + job)
- No moving goalposts
