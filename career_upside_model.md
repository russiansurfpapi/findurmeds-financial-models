# Career Opportunity Expected Value Analysis

## Assumptions & Framework

This model uses expected value (EV) = Σ(Probability × Outcome) across different scenarios.

**Time Horizon:** 5-7 years to liquidity/meaningful outcome
**Risk-adjusted discount rate:** Applied based on certainty of outcomes

---

## 1. FindUrMeds (Your Founded Company)

### Current Stage
- Pre-revenue/early revenue
- Founder equity: ~70-85% (assuming minimal dilution so far)
- Sector: Healthcare/pharmacy marketplace

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Exit Valuation | Your Stake | Your Proceeds | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Failure** | 60% | $0 | 75% | $0 | 2-3 years |
| **Small Exit** | 25% | $5-15M | 60% | $3-9M | 4-5 years |
| **Medium Exit** | 12% | $30-75M | 50% | $15-37.5M | 5-7 years |
| **Large Exit** | 3% | $150-300M | 40% | $60-120M | 7+ years |

**Expected Value Calculation:**
- (0.60 × $0) + (0.25 × $6M) + (0.12 × $26M) + (0.03 × $90M) = **$7.32M**

**Annual Opportunity Cost:** ~$0 salary for 2-3 years = -$300-500K in foregone income

**Adjusted EV (accounting for salary):** $7.32M - $400K = **~$6.9M**

**Additional Considerations:**
- Personal learning/network value: High
- Control over destiny: Maximum
- Stress/workload: Very high
- Career optionality if fails: Moderate to high (founder experience)

### Scenario Analysis (10-year view)

**Expected Value (10 years):**
- (0.70 × $4M) + (0.20 × $11.5M) + (0.08 × $35M) + (0.02 × $50M) = **$9.4M**

**Annual Average:** ~$940K/year

**Additional Considerations:**

## 3. Earlier Stage AI Startup (New Opportunity)

### Assumptions
- You'd be founder or co-founder (not employee)
- Hot sector with high multiples
- Strong technical/AI moat potential

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Exit Valuation | Your Stake | Your Proceeds | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Failure** | 55% | $0 | 30% | $0 | 2-3 years |
| **Small Exit** | 20% | $10-30M | 25% | $2.5-7.5M | 3-4 years |

| **Large Exit** | 8% | $300-800M | 15% | $45-120M | 6-8 years |
| **Unicorn+** | 2% | $1-3B | 12% | $120-360M | 7-10 years |

**Expected Value Calculation:**
- (0.55 × $0) + (0.20 × $5M) + (0.15 × $20M) + (0.08 × $82.5M) + (0.02 × $240M) = **$14.4M**

**Adjusted for opportunity cost:** $14.4M - $400K = **~$14M**

**Key Differences from FindUrMeds:**
- AI sector premiums (2-3x multiples vs traditional healthcare)
- Faster time to market/validation
- More competitive fundraising environment
- Lower probability of total failure if idea/team is strong
- Higher acquisition interest

**Additional Considerations:**

## Key Decision Factors

### Choose FindUrMeds if:
- You have strong conviction in the specific market/solution
- You're willing to accept binary outcome (success or $0)
- You want maximum control and learning
- The sunk cost is manageable (you're already in)

### Choose Kate Capital if:
- You want exposure to many companies vs betting on one
- Network and learning from best founders is priority
- You prefer lower personal stress than founder life
- You want a high-probability path to $5M+ with upside to $50M+
- You enjoy pattern recognition and advisory work

### Choose New AI Startup if:
- You have a truly differentiated idea/team
- You can get better co-founders/equity than FindUrMeds structure
- You believe AI tailwinds create 2-3x better odds than healthcare
- Willing to restart the founder journey

### Choose ElevenLabs if:
- You want to learn from a best-in-class AI company
- You prefer employee risk/reward vs founder risk/reward
- You value near-term salary and more predictable equity outcome
- You can get a leadership role (0.2-0.4% equity)
- You see this as "getting paid to learn" before founding later

---

## My Assessment (Based on the Model)

### If you're considering leaving FindUrMeds:

**Best pure expected value: ElevenLabs at leadership level ($18.4M) or new AI startup ($14M)**

**Best risk-adjusted: Kate Capital** - Exceptional network, high floor, still $10M+ upside

**Dark horse:** ElevenLabs as a 2-3 year "training ground" before founding a company with better expertise/network than you have now

### If you're staying with FindUrMeds:

The question becomes: **Do you have conviction that FindUrMeds has >15% probability of a $30M+ exit?**

If yes → Stay (EV becomes competitive)
If no → Kate Capital or ElevenLabs are higher EV

2. **Energy/passion**: Which would you work hardest at?
3. **Life stage**: Do you need salary now? Willing to do another 0-salary run?
4. **Network effects**: Kate Capital's network could 3-5x your next venture's success
5. **Optionality**: Kate Capital or ElevenLabs leave doors open; founder path is all-in
6. **Learning curve**: Where do you have the most to learn?
