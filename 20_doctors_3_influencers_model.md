## Part 1: Doctor Referral Channel (20 Doctors)

### Assumption Framework

**Key variables:**
1. How many patients does each doctor refer per month?
2. What's the mix of one-time searches vs recurring users?
3. What's the average revenue per patient?

### Doctor Referral Scenarios

| Scenario | Patients/Doctor/Month | % One-Time | % Recurring | Avg Revenue/Patient/Mo | Revenue per Doctor |
|----------|----------------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Conservative** | 2 patients | 80% | 20% | $12 | $240/month |
| **Realistic** | 4 patients | 70% | 30% | $16 | $384/month |
| **Optimistic** | 7 patients | 60% | 40% | $20 | $620/month |

**Calculation logic:**

**Conservative (2 patients/mo, mostly one-time):**
- 1.6 one-time searches @ $40 = $64
- 0.4 recurring users @ $40 first month + $7.50/mo thereafter = $16 + $3 = $19
- Total per doctor: ($64 × 5) + ($19 × 5) = $240/month per doctor

**Realistic (4 patients/mo, mix):**
- 2.8 one-time @ $40 = $112
- 1.2 recurring @ $40 + $7.50/mo = $48 + $9 = $57
- Total per doctor: ($112 × 5) + ($57 × 5) = $384/month per doctor

**Optimistic (7 patients/mo, many recurring):**
- 4.2 one-time @ $40 = $168
- 2.8 recurring @ $40 + $7.50/mo = $112 + $21 = $133
- Total per doctor: ($168 × 5) + ($133 × 5) = $620/month per doctor

### 20 Doctors Total Revenue

| Scenario | Revenue/Doctor/Month | Total Monthly (20 docs) | Annual Revenue |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Conservative** | $240 | **$4,800** | **$57,600** |
| **Realistic** | $384 | **$7,680** | **$92,160** |
| **Optimistic** | $620 | **$12,400** | **$148,800** |

## Part 2: Influencer Channel (3 Influencers)

### Influencer Tier Analysis

**Rebecca King example:**
- Followers: 218K
- Commission: 25-30% per signup

**Let's model 3 different influencer tiers:**

| Tier | Follower Count | Posts/Month | Conversion Rate | Customers/Month | Revenue/Customer | Gross Revenue | Commission (28%) | Net Revenue |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Micro (Tier 3)** | 50K | 2 | 0.02% | 20 | $40 | $800 | $224 | $576 |
| **Mid (Tier 2)** | 150K | 2 | 0.015% | 45 | $40 | $1,800 | $504 | $1,296 |
| **Macro (Tier 1)** | 250K+ | 3 | 0.01% | 75 | $40 | $3,000 | $840 | $2,160 |

### Influencer Mix Scenarios

**Conservative (3 micro influencers):**
- 3 × $576 = **$1,728/month**
- Annual: **$20,736**

**Realistic (2 micro, 1 mid):**
- 2 × $576 = $1,152
- 1 × $1,296 = $1,296
- Total: **$2,448/month**
- Annual: **$29,376**

**Optimistic (1 micro, 1 mid, 1 macro):**
- 1 × $576 = $576
- 1 × $1,296 = $1,296
- 1 × $2,160 = $2,160
- Total: **$4,032/month**
- Annual: **$48,384**

## Part 3: Combined Model (20 Doctors + 3 Influencers)

### Scenario A: Conservative Case

**20 doctors (low referrals) + 3 micro influencers**

| Channel | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Doctors (20 × $240) | $4,800 | $57,600 |
| Influencers (3 micro) | $1,728 | $20,736 |
| **TOTAL** | **$6,528** | **$78,336** |

**Analysis:**
- **65% of $120K lifestyle goal**
- You'd need supplemental income or to cut costs
- But this is VERY conservative (only 2 patients/doctor/month)

---

### Scenario B: Realistic Case ⭐ MOST LIKELY

**20 doctors (moderate referrals) + 2 micro + 1 mid influencer**

| Channel | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Doctors (20 × $384) | $7,680 | $92,160 |
| Influencers (2 micro + 1 mid) | $2,448 | $29,376 |
| **TOTAL** | **$10,128** | **$121,536** |

**Analysis:**
- **101% of $120K lifestyle goal** ✅
- You hit your salary replacement target
- Monthly income: $10,128
- After-tax (30%): ~$7,090/month
- This covers your desired lifestyle + savings

---

### Scenario C: Optimistic Case

**20 doctors (strong referrals) + 1 micro + 1 mid + 1 macro influencer**

| Channel | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Doctors (20 × $620) | $12,400 | $148,800 |
| Influencers (1 micro + 1 mid + 1 macro) | $4,032 | $48,384 |
| **TOTAL** | **$16,432** | **$197,184** |

**Analysis:**
- **164% of $120K lifestyle goal** 🚀
- You're making $197K/year
- After-tax: ~$138K take-home
- You can upgrade lifestyle significantly
- Room to hire help ($40-60K for VA/ops person)

---

## Part 4: Month-by-Month Build-Up

**How revenue grows as you add doctors and influencers over time**

### Assumption:
- Start with 0 doctors, 0 influencers
- Add 3-4 doctors/month via cold email
- Add 1 influencer every 2 months

| Month | Doctors | Influencers | Doctor Revenue | Influencer Revenue | Total Monthly | Annual Run Rate |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Month 1** | 2 | 0 | $768 | $0 | $768 | $9,216 |
| **Month 2** | 5 | 1 (micro) | $1,920 | $576 | $2,496 | $29,952 |
| **Month 3** | 8 | 1 | $3,072 | $576 | $3,648 | $43,776 |
| **Month 4** | 11 | 2 (micro) | $4,224 | $1,152 | $5,376 | $64,512 |
| **Month 5** | 14 | 2 | $5,376 | $1,152 | $6,528 | $78,336 |
| **Month 6** | 17 | 2 (1 micro, 1 mid) | $6,528 | $1,872 | $8,400 | $100,800 |
| **Month 7** | 20 | 3 (2 micro, 1 mid) | $7,680 | $2,448 | **$10,128** | **$121,536** ✅ |

**Time to $120K run rate: 7 months** (if you can add 3 doctors/month consistently)

## Part 5: Detailed Doctor Referral Mechanics

### How does a doctor refer 4 patients/month? (Realistic scenario)

**Doctor profile: ADHD psychiatrist with 80 active patients**

**Referral triggers:**
1. **New prescriptions (2/month):** "I just prescribed you Vyvanse. Use FindUrMeds to find it in stock - saves you hours of calling around."
2. **Refill issues (1/month):** Patient mentions pharmacy is out of stock → "Try FindUrMeds"
3. **Cost complaints (1/month):** Patient mentions price concerns → "FindUrMeds can help you find better prices"

**Monthly flow:**
- 80 patients × 5% have issues = 4 referrals/month

**This is VERY achievable for an engaged doctor.**

---

### What does the doctor need to do?

**Option 1: Passive referral (lowest effort)**
- Include FindUrMeds link in prescription emails/patient portal
- Mention verbally when relevant
- **Effort: 30 seconds per patient = 2 minutes/month**

**Option 2: Active referral (medium effort)**
- Keep FindUrMeds cards/flyers in office
- Hand to patients when writing prescriptions
- Text link to patients when they call about shortages
- **Effort: 2-3 minutes per patient = 12 minutes/month**

**Option 3: White-glove referral (high effort - less realistic)**
- Doctor's office staff submits FindUrMeds requests for patients
- **Effort: 15 minutes/month + staff time**

**Most doctors will do Option 1-2, which easily generates 2-4 referrals/month.**

---

## Part 6: Detailed Influencer Mechanics

### How does an influencer with 150K followers drive 45 customers/month?

**Rebecca King example (218K followers, ADHD nutrition niche)**

**Post frequency: 2 posts/month**

**Post types:**
1. **Story post:** "I've been using FindUrMeds to find my ADHD meds in stock - it's saved me SO much time. Link in bio!"
2. **Educational post:** "If you're struggling to find your ADHD medication, here are 5 strategies [thread]. #5 is FindUrMeds - they call pharmacies for you."

**Engagement math:**
- 150K followers
- 3-5% see the post = 4,500-7,500 views
- 1-2% click link = 45-150 clicks
- 20-40% of clicks convert = **9-60 signups per post**

**2 posts/month = 18-120 customers/month**

**Realistic middle: 45 customers/month** (0.015% conversion of total audience)

**Revenue:**
- 45 customers × $40 = $1,800 gross
- 28% commission = $504 to influencer
- **$1,296 net to you**

---

### What does the influencer need to do?

**Minimal effort version:**
1. Post about FindUrMeds 2x/month (mix of stories + feed posts)
2. Use unique tracking link
3. Respond to DMs about it

**Effort: 30-45 minutes per month**

**High effort version:**
1. Create dedicated tutorial/review content
2. Feature in newsletter
3. Create discount code for followers
4. Share testimonials from followers who used it

**Effort: 2-3 hours per month**

**Most influencers do minimal effort, which still generates 20-60 customers/month depending on audience size.**

---

## Part 7: Risk Factors & Sensitivity Analysis

### What could go wrong?

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Doctors stop referring after 3 months** | -50% doctor revenue | Focus on doctor satisfaction, ask for feedback, provide value |
| **Influencer posts don't convert** | -100% influencer revenue | Test smaller influencers first, optimize commission structure |
| **Patient churn (one-time only)** | -30% overall revenue | Build recurring value (monthly confirmation calls, price alerts) |
| **Competition emerges** | -20-40% revenue | Build doctor loyalty, white-label for clinics, add features |

### Sensitivity Analysis: What if doctors refer LESS?

| Avg Patients/Doctor/Month | 20 Doctors Revenue | With 3 Influencers | Total Annual |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **1 patient** | $2,400/mo | $4,848/mo | $58,176 |
| **2 patients** | $4,800/mo | $7,248/mo | $86,976 |
| **3 patients** | $6,240/mo | $8,688/mo | $104,256 |
| **4 patients** | $7,680/mo | $10,128/mo | **$121,536** ✅ |
| **5 patients** | $9,600/mo | $12,048/mo | $144,576 |

**Insight:** You need doctors to refer at least 3-4 patients/month on average to hit $120K.

**If doctors only refer 2/month → You're at $87K (72% of goal)**

---

## Part 8: How Long Does It Take to Get to 20 Doctors + 3 Influencers?

### Doctor Acquisition Timeline

**Current status:**
- Cold email: 5% conversion to meetings
- Meeting to signed doctor: ??? (unknown, let's assume 20%)
- Net conversion: 1% (5% × 20%)

**Math:**
- Email 100 doctors → 5 meetings → 1 signed doctor
- To get 20 doctors: Email 2,000 doctors

**Timeline scenarios:**

| Emails per Day | Days to 2,000 Emails | Signed Doctors/Week | Weeks to 20 Doctors |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **25/day** | 80 days (2.7 months) | 1.75 | 11.4 weeks (~3 months) |
| **50/day** | 40 days (1.3 months) | 3.5 | 5.7 weeks (~1.5 months) |
| **100/day** | 20 days (0.7 months) | 7 | 2.9 weeks (~3 weeks) |

**Realistic path: 50 emails/day → 20 doctors in 6-8 weeks** (accounting for follow-ups, close time, etc.)

---

### Influencer Acquisition Timeline

**Current status:**
- 1 signed (Rebecca King, unproven)
- Conversion rate: Unknown

**Influencer outreach strategy:**
- Target: ADHD influencers with 50K-300K followers
- Pool size: ~200 ADHD influencers on Instagram/TikTok
- Outreach method: Commission-only (25-30% per signup)

**Realistic conversion:**
- Reach out to 30 influencers
- 10% respond positively = 3 interested
- 50% actually post = 1.5 active influencers

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Build list of 30 influencers
- Week 3-4: Outreach to all 30
- Week 5-6: Negotiate with 3 interested
- Week 7-8: Get 1-2 to post

**Time to 3 influencers: 3-4 months** (ongoing outreach + testing)

## Part 10: Key Assumptions to Validate ASAP

### Critical Questions You Need to Answer in Next 30 Days:

1. **Doctor close rate:**
   - "Of the 5% who take meetings, how many actually sign up to refer?"
   - Current assumption: 20%
   - **Test:** Send 100 emails this week, measure actual close rate

2. **Doctor referral frequency:**
   - "Does an average doctor refer 2, 4, or 7 patients per month?"
   - Current assumption: 4 patients/month
   - **Test:** Ask Rebecca King to refer 3 patients this month, see if she can

3. **Patient stickiness:**
   - "What % become recurring users vs one-time?"
   - Current assumption: 30% recurring
   - **Test:** Follow up with your 3 existing customers, ask if they'll use again

4. **Influencer conversion:**
   - "Does Rebecca actually drive signups or is this all theoretical?"
   - **Test:** Get Rebecca to post THIS WEEK, measure actual signups

---

## Part 11: What You Need to Do This Week

### Week 1 Action Plan: Validate the Model

**Monday-Tuesday: Doctor channel test**
- [ ] Send 50 cold emails to ADHD psychiatrists
- [ ] Track: Opens, replies, meeting requests
- [ ] Goal: Get 2-3 meetings scheduled

**Wednesday: Rebecca King test**
- [ ] Call Rebecca: "Can you post about FindUrMeds this week?"
- [ ] Give her custom tracking link
- [ ] Measure: How many signups in 7 days?

**Thursday-Friday: Follow-up with existing customers**
- [ ] Email your 3 existing customers
- [ ] Ask: "Will you use FindUrMeds again next month?"
- [ ] Ask: "How did you find us?" (solve the organic mystery)

**Weekend: Influencer outreach**
- [ ] Build list of 20 ADHD influencers (50K-300K followers)
- [ ] Draft outreach message (commission structure)
- [ ] Send 10 outreach messages

---

## Summary: The Numbers

**20 Doctors + 3 Influencers = $121,536/year (realistic case)**

**Breakdown:**
- 20 doctors × 4 patients/month × $16 blended revenue = $7,680/month
- 3 influencers (2 micro, 1 mid) = $2,448/month
- **Total: $10,128/month = $121,536/year**

**This hits your $120K lifestyle goal.**

**Time to build:**
- Aggressive: 5 months
- Moderate: 7 months
- Conservative: 12 months

**Critical path:**
- Email 50 doctors/day
- Close 3-4 doctors/month
- Sign 1 influencer every 2 months
- Keep doctors engaged and referring

**Biggest risk:**
- Doctors refer <3 patients/month → You miss $120K target
- **Mitigation:** Over-recruit doctors (get 25-30 instead of 20)

**Next 30 days:**
- Validate doctor close rate (send 200 emails)
- Validate Rebecca actually refers (get her to post)
- Validate patient recurring rate (talk to existing customers)

**Decision point in 30 days:**
- ✅ If close rate >15% and Rebecca drives >10 signups → GO ALL IN
- 🟡 If close rate 5-15% or Rebecca drives 3-10 signups → CONTINUE TESTING
- ❌ If close rate <5% and Rebecca drives <3 signups → PIVOT OR STOP
